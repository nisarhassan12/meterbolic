As there is another post in the works on the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), I’m going to sum up the fasting metrics very briefly and expand more of the postprandial measurement. To better understand lipid, and more specifically, triglyceride metabolism, it is difficult to recommend a single review. There is of course the 4th edition of the fantastic book by Prof. Keith N. Frayn (of Oxford University) [1], but that is not a short and simple update if you need one. Perhaps a good enough introduction would be the book chapter “Introduction to Lipids and Lipoproteins” by Feingold and Grunfeld in the free Endotext [2]. If you are already there another chapter provides further insight into triglyceride metabolism and the risks associated with elevation in both fasting and postprandial levels: “Risk of Fasting and Non-Fasting Hypertriglyceridemia in Coronary Vascular Disease and Pancreatitis” [3].

Briefly, the level of fasting triglycerides correlates well with insulin level, and with insulin resistance (IR) especially when combined with fasting glucose. This provides a cheap and convenient metric like HOMA-IR. However, the TyG index has the very same issues that other fasting indices do: it is unable to detect the majority of early metabolic derangements. To pick those up one needs a postprandial/meal tolerance test. As fatty acid uptake is an early indicator of IR, elevated and/or longer elevation of triglyceride level can be implemented in postprandial measurements.

Why is reduced lipid uptake an early indicator of IR? One of the major metabolically active organs is white adipose tissue (WAT). In fact, ectopic lipid accumulation (i.e. in places where it should only be stored at low levels) is typically the result of WAT dysfunction. In other words, when lipids cannot be safely stored in WAT to the extent it is required by diet and metabolic status, fatty acids overflow to other organs [4]. These could theoretically also store more lipids in a safe way, but the mentioned flood of fatty acids does not arrive salon, but accompanied by inflammatory signaling molecules, hormones (e.g. higher leptin and visfatin, and lower adiponectin), and cytokines (e.g. elevated portal IL-6), originating from the stressed-out main storage organ [5]. What is more, pre-adipocytes were shown to leave WAT and find a new home as mature fat cells in ectopic organs, such as in skeletal muscle [6]. The net effects of these factors represent the most likely causal problem for mentioned ectopic deposition and initiation of local inflammation and IR [7].

There are two main transport forms of fatty acids in the blood: free fatty acids (FFA) travel after liberation in adipose tissues towards organs that use it as a fuel, or the liver esterifies (bonds it to glycerol molecules) and subsequently repackages it into lipoprotein, mainly VLDL particles. This form, as well as the repackaged and chylomicron contained fatty acids are triglycerides (TG or TAG, the latter being short for triacyl-glycerol), comprising the second main type of circulating fats. Although triglycerides are often considered a transport form, these glycerol-bound fatty acids can be liberated not only at adipose tissues for uptake and storage, but also at other tissues and organs, for instance the heart and skeletal muscles. In fact, there is a constant cycling between metabolically active organs, i.e. the liver, adipose tissues, and the small intestine, ensuring proper availability by increasing or dropping the rate of cycling. This cycling also plays important signaling roles via different fatty acid profiles and derivatives (sphingolipids) that characterize release at various tissues [8]. As outlined in Section VIII of the mentioned review [8], metabolic diseases are always accompanied by disturbances in glycerolipid cycling, likely some or most of these being even initiated by disruption of the cycle.

Even though knowing its dynamics may be at least as meaningful, measuring FFA is technically difficult even in a clinical setting. Instead, TG are routinely determined in the fasting state, but can be measured and interpreted in the postprandial phase as well. At this time, we are interested in the utility of determining postprandial levels, or in other words its dynamics. Lipid metabolism is a bit trickier than that of glucose, in that fatty acids do not simply pass through the

intestinal wall. While glucose take-up by intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells) results in a closely corresponding increase in blood, FFA (and monoacyl-glycerol), which are taken up from the intestinal lumen, are first converted back to TG and can be stored in the form of lipid droplets within enterocytes, and only released later. In line with this, the first wave of chylomicrons (lipoproteins secreted by enterocytes containing ApoB-48 proteins) often contain lipids from the previous meal, not from the just ingested one. This makes levels and dynamics a bit less well correlated to the meal under examination, but not to the extent that values could become of no or little use. In fact, postprandial lipid dynamics is closely related to changes in glucose, but the latter can be masked by a non-stressing mixed meal. Technically, the microdialysis study by McQuaid et al. [4], which is still one of my absolute favorites, showed that in visceral obesity (= IR) there are three parameters that correlate very closely in adipose tissues following a mixed meal: blood flow, glucose extraction, and TG uptake. Note the order, as it is likely very important. The conclusion we can draw based on this is that WAT insulin resistance, which may manifest mainly as decreased blood flow, results in a decreased uptake of glucose via the GLUT4 pathway. This pathway is directly linked to fatty acid re-esterification (synthesis and storage of TG), because glycerol cannot be recycled in WAT due to lack of a key enzyme, so it has to be synthesized via glyceroneogenesis, a process that shares several enzymes with the gluconeogenic pathway [reviewed in 9]. The ultimate problem is that if there is a disturbance in glucose uptake into WAT it is automatically linked to reduced glycerol synthesis and eventually to impaired lipid storage. Lower storage, higher overflow in the blood and in other tissues, finally ectopic deposition. Proper glucose uptake is more important in adipose tissues, as shown by specific KO models, than in skeletal muscle, despite the one order of magnitude lower level of absolute uptake. This is an ultimate signaling hub, and as such, quality trumps quantity. Insulin must follow the increased need for suppressing lipolysis to avoid direct and immediate lipotoxicity, but higher insulin has minimal effect on re-esterification of FA to TG [10 and see Fig.4. from that paper attached]

Since, unlike muscles for glucose, there is no backup plan for massive amounts of dietary fats, all in all, above highlight the importance and utility of monitoring lipid uptake after a meal. And that’s exactly where TG come into the picture. The expectation therefore is that in insulin resistant individuals, TG reach higher peaks and linger around longer than in insulin sensitive people, following the reduction in uptake to WAT, as discussed above.

<strong>End of Part I.</strong>

Let us see how it works in studies that specifically investigated this. A nice study done on 145 type 2 diabetics and 30 healthy controls back in 2004 clearly supports the hypotheses put forward [11]. Diabetics had not only elevated fasting TG, but also failed to properly clear lipids from their blood after a lunch and dinner sequence of mixed meals. What is more, their TG level increased with every meal, and the second meal was taken well before the first was cleared from the blood, increasing the spike even further after dinner than following lunch. The same phenomenon can be observed in the introductory discussion (ref. 4 there). The study used a cutoff value of 2 mmol/L, added as a horizontal line in the graph below:

(Unit conversion for TG: 1 mmol/L = 88.5 mg/dL, or use a calculator, e.g. this one: https://unitslab.com/node/53)
